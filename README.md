# Tesla Coil and Useless Box kits
Two kits for the Ardiuno users to which we can add value at least to one of them

# See https://www.youtube.com/RalphBacon video #100

To show that not all things Arduino (or electronic) have to be serious, we have here two projects that appear, on the face of it, to be pretty useless (to use Arduinites, at least). Really?

Well, no. Watch the video and see how at least one of them can be used to really let the imagination run riot as we Add Value to the project. A chance to show off your skills (albeit fairly simple ones that are required). If you have kids both these projects will keep them engaged for at least 5 minutes. That's each.

On a slightly more serious side, we do learn a lot about Nikola Tesla's coil and what he was trying to do. And the magic of a light bulb glowing without being plugged in is surely worth a couple of dollars or so for a Tesla kit?

And we discover a lot about how to reverse engineer a simple circuit and then add value to an otherwise "useless" box.  A bit of lateral thinking and your creativity can run wild as you add enhancements.
